Q3. REGEXP GOLF
Code golf is a term used for the game of trying to express a particular program in as few characters as
possible. Similarly, regexp golf is the practice of writing as tiny a regular expression as possible to match a
given pattern and only that pattern.
For each of the following items, write a regular expression to test whether the given pattern occurs in a string.
The regular expression should match only strings containing the pattern. When your expression works, see
whether you can make it any smaller.
1. car and cat
2. pop and prop
3. ferret, ferry, and ferrari
4. Any word ending in ious
5. A whitespace character followed by a period, comma, colon, or semicolon
6. A word longer than six letters
7. A word without the letter e (or E)
Refer to the table in the chapter summary for help. Test each solution with a few test strings.
// Fill in the regular expressions
